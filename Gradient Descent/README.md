📉 Gradient Descent from Scratch
Welcome to the Gradient Descent project — a hands-on and visual deep dive into one of the most fundamental optimization algorithms in machine learning. This notebook walks you through how gradient descent works under the hood, using Python and NumPy only — no machine learning libraries involved!

🧠 What You'll Learn
✅ How gradient descent works step-by-step
✅ Deriving and using gradients manually
✅ Implementing linear regression with gradient descent
✅ Visualizing model training and convergence using Matplotlib
